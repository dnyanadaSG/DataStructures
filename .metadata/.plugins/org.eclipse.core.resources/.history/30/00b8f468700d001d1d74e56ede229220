/*
 * The various types of linked lists are as follows:

Singly Linked List: It is the most basic linked list in which traversal is 
unidirectional i.e. from the head node to the last node.

Doubly Linked List: In this linked list, traversal can be done in both ways, 
and hence it requires an extra pointer.

Circular Linked List: This linked list is unidirectional but in this list, 
the last node points to the first i.e. the head node and hence it becomes 
circular in nature.

Circular Doubly Linked List: The circular doubly linked list is a combination 
of the doubly linked list and the circular linked list. It means that this 
linked list is bidirectional and contains two pointers and the last pointer 
points to the first pointer.
